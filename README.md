# Epidemic-Simulator
## A somewhat accurate simulation of an Epidemic

This is a simulator that shows the outcome of an epidemic depending on different variables.

It is not an especially accurate simulator since it does not simulate movement or individual hygiene, but it can give a basic idea of how diseases spread.
